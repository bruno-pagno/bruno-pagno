### Hi there 👋

## About me 👨‍💻
My name is Bruno Pagno, and I'm a Information Systems student at [University of São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo), currently at the 4° period.
I'm currently working on [Darwin Careers](https://www.darwincareers.com/) as a fullstack software engineer, which I'm also partner. Darwin is a recruiting company that brings people from academia to the private sector.
